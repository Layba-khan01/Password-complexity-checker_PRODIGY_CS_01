The Password Complexity Checker is an application that evaluates a password's security level based on its length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It categorizes password strength into Very Weak, Weak, Good, or Strong and provides suggestions for improvement.

It is built using Python and Tkinter, making it a simple yet effective tool for personal and professional use.
