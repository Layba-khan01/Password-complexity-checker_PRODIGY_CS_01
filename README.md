The Password Complexity Checker is an application that evaluates a password's security level based on its length, and use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It categorizes password strength into Very Weak, Weak, Good, or Strong and provides suggestions for improvement.<br>
It is built using Python and Tkinter, making it a simple yet effective tool for personal and professional use. <br>

🛠 Technologies Used<br>
1️⃣ Python<br>
• The core programming language is used to develop the logic behind password assessment.<br>
• Uses Regular Expressions (re module) to check for different character types in the password.<br>
2️⃣ Tkinter (Python's GUI Library)<br>
• Used for creating a user-friendly graphical interface.<br>
• Provides labels, buttons, and entry fields to interact with the user.<br>
3️⃣ Regular Expressions (Regex)<br>
• Helps validate passwords by checking the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>

🚀 Features of the Password Complexity Checker<br>
1️⃣ Graphical User Interface (GUI)<br>
• The tool has a simple and intuitive interface using Tkinter.<br>
• Users can enter a password, click a button, and instantly get feedback.<br>
2️⃣ Password Strength Evaluation<br>
Evaluate passwords based on:<br>
✅ Length<br>
✅ Uppercase letters<br>
✅ Lowercase letters<br>
✅ Numbers<br>
✅ Special characters<br>
3️⃣ Strength Categorization<br>
The tool assigns a strength level:<br>
• Very Weak (score < 40)<br>
• Weak (score between 40-59)<br>
• Good (score between 60-79)<br>
• Strong (score ≥ 80)<br>
4️⃣ Detailed Feedback for Improvement<br>
If a password is weak, the tool provides suggestions such as:<br>
"Include uppercase letters."<br>
"Add special characters like @, #, !, $."<br>
"Increase password length to at least 8 characters."<br>  
5️⃣ Hidden Password Input  
• The password entry field hides characters using show="*" to protect user input.  
6️⃣ Responsive Design  
• The GUI automatically adjusts to window resizing, making it user-friendly.
